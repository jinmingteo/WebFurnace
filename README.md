Proposed level of achievement: Gemini

Target Audience: Web designers/developers, consumers looking for web designers/developers

Motivation:

As many companies strive to be found on the Internet, many usually create their own company’s websites with the help of web designers/developers. The people they employ are usually from friends’ recommendation. Sometimes, these web designers/developers are unable to deliver what these companies want or charges exorbitant prices. As such, why not develop an app connecting web designers/developers across the world and providing a one-stop portal for these consumers to choose their preferred web designers/developers from? That’s exactly the purpose WebFurnace seeks to achieve.

Aim:
 
We hope to showcase web designers/developers across the globe to people who want to create their own website.

Functionalities:
 

Allows web designers/developers and employers/users to create and update/edit their own individual accounts/profiles. [CRUD]

Bulletin board for consumers/users to post their requests, stating their requirements, proposed price for the website they want to create as well as the completion time (eg whether it is urgent etc)

Social Integration (Facebook)


Testing:

Private message function still does not work perfectly

As we soon realized that there are a lot of bugs that surfaced due to the inevitable change of files directory, we have not updated our website after milestone 3 submission. All the edits after milestone 3 evaluations' are done on our testing local server.
