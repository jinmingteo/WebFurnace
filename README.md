Proposed level of achievement: Gemini

 

Target Audience: Web designers/developers, consumers looking for web designers/developers

 

Motivation:

 

As many companies strive to be found on the Internet, many usually create their own company’s websites with the help of web designers/developers. The people they employ are usually from friends’ recommendation. Sometimes, these web designers/developers are unable to deliver what these companies want or charges exorbitant prices. As such, why not develop an app connecting web designers/developers across the world and providing a one-stop portal for these consumers to choose their preferred web designers/developers from? That’s exactly the purpose WebFurnace seeks to achieve.

 

Aim:

 

We hope to showcase web designers/developers across the globe to people who want to create their own website.

 

Functionalities:

 

Allows web designers/developers and employers/users to create and update/edit their own individual accounts/profiles. [CRUD]
- Optional for web designers/developers to indicate if they are freelance or full-time developers

Bulletin board for consumers/users to post their requests, stating their requirements, proposed price for the website they want to create as well as the completion time (eg whether it is urgent etc)

Search function that allows users to search for job posts 

Comments section for each job post



Testing:

Private message function still does not work

We face great difficulty in implementing the private message function due to the nature of our app, it involving 2 different types of users - designers and consumers. As such, we decided to have a comments section in place of the PM function. Although it cannot replace the PM function totally, it still allows users to interact.

 

 

Technologies and tools used in the project:

Hosting Server: x10host.com

Scripting/PHP: Laravel

HTML/CSS: Sublime Text 3

Database: mySQL

Website: http://v2webfurnace.x10host.com/

As we soon realized that there are a lot of bugs that surfaced due to the inevitable change of files directory, we have not updated our website after milestone 3 submission. All the edits after milestone 3 evaluations' are done on our testing local server.
